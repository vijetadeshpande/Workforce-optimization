    "# Workforce Planning Project: Emergency Care Environment\n",

    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant need of nurses in a hospital for many important tasks impart an economic burden on hospital's monetary resources. The problem of optimizing the number of working nurses has two important aspects, first is to predict number of incoming patients and second is planning working shifts of nurses in such a way that number of nurses working at each hour of the day is just enough to satisfy the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we'll focus on the planning part of the problem and will assume the demand for nurses at each hour of the day is known. To do so, we are formulating an Integer Programming problem which will minimize the number of nurse-hours for a day given the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model is formulated as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Indices:\n",
    "1. i = 1, 2, ... , 32 ==> Hours of the day \n",
    "Here, i = 1 to 8 (0 to 7 in python, as index starts from 0) does belong to 17 to 24th hour from past day. While i = 9 to 32 will represent 1 to 24th hour of current day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. j = 1, ... , 3 ==> index for different lenghts of shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Parameters, sets, data:\n",
    "1. s = {}\n",
    "This set consists of the hours of the day at which nurses cannot start the shift\n",
    "\n",
    "2. D = []\n",
    "This array will have demand at each hour of the day\n",
    "\n",
    "3. shift_length = [4, 6, 8]\n",
    "This array will have 'j' elements for different allowed length for shift\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Decision variables\n",
    "$X_{i,j}$, will represent number of nurses starting their shift at the $i^{th}$ hour for $j^{th}$ length\n",

    "#### D.  Mathematical Model\n",
